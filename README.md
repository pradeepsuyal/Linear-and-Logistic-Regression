**Introduction**
------------------------
In this Repository, I have work on two dataset with two different model i.e, linear and logistic regression and perform exploratory data analysis

**Linear regression**
----------------------

Linear Regression is a statistical supervised learning technique to predict the quantitative variable by forming a linear relationship with one or more independent features.
It helps determine:

→ If a independent variable does a good job in predicting the dependent variable.

→ Which independent variable plays a significant role in predicting the dependent variable.

**Data used**
-------------------------
It is about an ***Ecommerce company*** based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. 

***about the data***
-------------------------
We'll work with the Ecommerce Customers csv file from the company. It has Customer info, suchas Email, Address, and their color Avatar. Then it also has numerical value columns:

⋅⋅⋅Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.

⋅⋅⋅Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes

⋅⋅⋅Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes

⋅⋅⋅Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.

**Logistic Regression**
----------------------------
It’s a classification algorithm, that is used where the response variable is categorical. The idea of Logistic Regression is to find a relationship between features and probability of particular outcome.

E.g. When we have to predict if a student passes or fails in an exam when the number of hours spent studying is given as a feature, the response variable has two values, pass and fail.

**Data used**
--------------------------
In this project we will be working with a ***fake advertising*** data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement on a company website. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

***about the data***
--------------------------
This data set contains the following features:

⋅⋅⋅'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on site in minutes

⋅⋅⋅'Age': cutomer age in years

⋅⋅⋅'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer

⋅⋅⋅'Daily Internet Usage': Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet

⋅⋅⋅'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement

⋅⋅⋅'City': City of consumer

⋅⋅⋅'Male': Whether or not consumer was male

⋅⋅⋅'Country': Country of consumer

⋅⋅⋅'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window

⋅⋅⋅'Clicked on Ad': 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad
